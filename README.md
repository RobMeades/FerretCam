# 3D Printed Parts
All of the 3D printed parts are designed in Blender 100 times larger than real life, so something 1 centimetre long will be 1 metre long in this Blender file.  For 3D printing the parts should be exported to STL with a scale factor of 10 (since in Blender a scale factor of 1000 would result in STL actual size).

There are 5 parts:

* the two parts of the stalk that holds the webcam and LED,
* a large washer,
* a spacer to go underneath the PSU to avoid it fowling some things,
* a piece to hold the webcam itself.

The stalk should be printed at 0.1 mm resolution (with supports added in the slicer program) while the spacer/webcam holder should be printed at 0.2 mm resolution (no supports required).  I used black ASA for these parts since I had it lying around but PLA is perfectly acceptable.  The large washer was printed in flexible PLA at 0.2 mm resolution and a nice slow 15 mm/s print speed.
