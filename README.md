# 3D Printed Parts
All of the 3D printed parts are rendered in Blender 100 times larger than real life, so something 1 centimetre long will be 1 metre long in Blender.  For 3D printing they should be exported to STL with a scale factor of 10, since Blender usually works 1000 times larger than real life.

There are 5 parts:

* the two parts of the stalk that holds the webcam and LED,
* a large washer,
* a spacer to go underneath the PSU to avoid it fowling some things,
* a piece to hold the webcam itself.

The stalk I printed in black ASA (in order to be UV-safe) at 0.1 mm resolution with full supports while the spacer/webcam holder I printed in ASA at 0.2 mm resolution (no supports required).  The large washer was printed in black flexible PLA at 0.2 mm resolution and a nice slow 15 mm/s print speed.
